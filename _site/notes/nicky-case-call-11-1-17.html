  <li>His why: understanding. Understanding systems.</li>
  <li>So many directions
    <ul>
      <li>Making explorables</li>
      <li>Making tools enables others to make explorable explainations, games, models, learn by making.</li>

    <ol>
      <li>All about connections</li>
      <li>Know who your audience is (so you know their connections)

      <li>Start with graph of knowledge / endpoint</li>
      <li>Start point: start with why.

  d. Story

  a. Draw 3 outlines first to think about different structures 
  b. Outline look like boxes with words connected by arrows of “therefore” or “but” (South Park guys)
  c. Can do “meanwhile back at the ranch”</li>
      <li>For each node in graph, connect to things people already know
  a. Metaphors to things people already know about
  b. Examples
  c. Show
  d. Allow audience to “do”</li>
      <li>“Kill your darlings” 
  a. Get rid of tangents. 
  b. Get feedback from friends</li>
