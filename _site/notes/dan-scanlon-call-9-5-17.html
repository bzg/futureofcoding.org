      <li>leaving now, because of a cash crunch</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Futurism

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In free time, future of programming research
    <ul>
      <li>Bret Victor, stop drawing dead fish, and dynamic visualizations
        <ul>
          <li>funciton out of sequences through interactions with canvas
            <ul>
              <li>start with line</li>

          <li>new reframing
            <ul>
              <li>types as shapes makes things more intuative
                <ul>
                  <li>he wasnts to think about types as spaces
                    <ul>
                      <li>boolean is a number line, but only at 0 or 1</li>

                  </li>
                  <li>interact with something in space
                    <ul>
                      <li>that interaction turns into a series of frames</li>
                      <li>“moving a fish vertically up will cause one frame be to created”</li>
                      <li>“how do I animate moving the fish up?”
                        <ul>
                          <li>loop the sequence so that last position of the fish is the new origin</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>

          <li>FramerJS
            <ul>
              <li>constrast: it’s not UI-data-binding, because the thing you’re interacting with in the canvas is not neccesarily a visual output
                <ul>
                  <li>can visualize any Abstract Data Types</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

          <li>trying to think it out in his head, hypothetically</li>
          <li>TODO Elliot Conal denotational design</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Get his feedback on my research
    <ul>
      <li>StreamSheets
        <ul>
          <li>The inspiration of his project (Aberration) is in order to have a truly powerful system, you have to be able to manipulate the lower levels of a system within that system so you can “lift the hood”
            <ul>
              <li>Related to Alan Kay STEPS</li>
            </ul>

          <li>Thinking about the complex pieces of data that will push the boundaries of your interface
            <ul>
              <li>Visualizing nested objects, for example, was hard in a prior prototype of his but will be better in Aberration
                <ul>
                  <li>TODO ask if he has picture of Aberration</li>
                </ul>

              <li>you have x-position and y-position</li>
            </ul>
