# Reflection 10

## TODO

* read http://futureofcoding.org/episodes/18-research-recap-nine.html
* read other entries from http://futureofcoding.org/log#test-_data-git-log-json

## Bret Deep Dive 

### Really useful

There's so much that I missed in the first reading/watching, especially all of his references and sources. For example, I LOVED the interview with Will Wright that he linked to in Learnable Programming -- it's making me seriously consider creating video games like Nicky Case.

### Re-read all my notes? TODO

http://futureofcoding.org/notes/bret-victor/

This will take a few hours. Probably useful. Just so much time!

### LogicHub was (kinda) his idea

[In my journal I wrote](http://futureofcoding.org/log#so-many-of-my-ideas):

> In particular I was shocked by how many of my favorite ideas Bret also wrote about, including... LogicHub, a wiki-like platform for understanding and argumentation with nested sources.

As Bret says in [Ten Brighter Ideas?](http://worrydream.com/TenBrighterIdeas/)

> As you explore this document, imagine a world where we expect every claim to be accompanied by an explorable analysis, and every statistic to be linked to a primary source. Imagine collecting data and designing analyses in a collaborative wiki-like manner.

Of course, this isn't *exactly* my vision for LogicHub. I still feel it's important to have precise langauge and community "voting" on the logical-ness of connections.

## Thinking about the futureofcoding (TODO find a better spot for these sections, they are not reflections)

### Alan Kay

In interview with Jason Brennan, he said Alan Kay's purpose is "everyone a scientist." Made me think of this recent BV tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Goal: 9 billion scientists by 2050. <a href="https://t.co/Nit7wurjeH">pic.twitter.com/Nit7wurjeH</a></p>&mdash; Bret Victor (@worrydream) <a href="https://twitter.com/worrydream/status/931017433489346561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I surmised the definition of "scientist" relevant here is someone comitted to getting around our human biases to reduce our uncertainty. In Alan's words, "the process of scientific thinking is able to deal with many of
our own inabilities to think and other flaws in a strong enough manner to still come up with ever more accurate mappings of more and more complex parts of our universe." [The Human Condition](http://www.vpri.org/pdf/m2003001_human_cond.pdf)

> HARC's mission [is] to ensure that human wisdom exceeds human power, by inventing and freely sharing ideas and technology that allow all humans to see further and understand more deeply

[Another Alan Quote](http://www.squeakland.org/resources/articles/article.jsp?id=1003):

> This is what our work and Squeak is all about. We are interested in helping children learn to think better and deeper than most adults can. We have made the Squeak medium to serve as a new kind of electronic paper that can hold new ways to represent powerful ideas. We have written examples of this new literature and they are published over the Internet for children and adults to "read" and play with. Readers can also become writers, because "authoring is always on". In fact, much of the learning of this new way to represent and think is best done by "authoring along with the author" in what we call "active essays". To try one of these out right away, look at "Methinks It Is A Weasel", an active essay about one part of Evolution. 

That's pretty clear. I'm realizing that this purpose and Elon's to get us to Mars are very similar in tone: averting existential risks aflicted on humanity by humanity. I'm less worried about these risks, even more so after reading *Better Angels of Our Nature* which talks about how humans continue to get less violent over time.

The mission of us "getting around our biases" sounds similar to [Steph Jang's mission](http://stephjang.com/about/):

> I’m working on helping people reprogram themselves to achieve their goals.
>
> My personal mission is to equip myself and others with the tools, know-how, and support to become more compassionate and competent human beings.
>
> Why? To turbocharge humanity’s ability to solve our biggest problems (e.g., inequality, disease — including mental illness, terrorism, climate change) and establish a more peaceful, equitable, self-actualized society.

Again very large and problem-solve-y.

#### Making wrong vs possibility TODO

It makes me think about the distinction from Landmark, of "making wrong" vs "possibility." A lot of these missions, to my ears, come from a "making wrong" place. A place of sadness, regret, and inadequacy. A place of recognizing "problems." And then wanting to "fix" them.

It may be more fun and productive to accept the world as it is, and as it is not. Then meditate on the most important things. Then think about ways to reimagine the most important things. Then think about the pros vs cons of each of the new ideas, and then if one of them has many more pros then cons, work on making it into a reality.

Let's come up with a metaphor for this. The metaphor for "making wrong" is easy: it's a teacher assigning problems, having you solve them, and then marking you right or wrong on them. The metaphor for "possibility" is a little more amorphous. I imagine a brainstorming session or a make-believe game kids make up or a "what do I want to be when I grow up" conversation. 

I haven't reviewed it recently but I get the sense that SmallTalk and the Dynabook were created out of possibility. Yet Alan's *New Computing Technologies* project starts with "making wrong":

> Code is too: large, complex, costly, buggy, insecure, segregated, and inexpressive

Of course, this discussion is quite related to John Dewey's notion of a positive philosphy for progressive education, based on experience, as opposed to a reactionary one based on what we don't like in standard ed. 

### Thinking about income TODO

## Miscellaneous updates

### Custom log page

This has come along really nicely! I'm honestly a little surprised how much fun I had building this page. What's funny is that I had the idea for making this page in my last research reflection time and came up with the basic structure for doing it locally, statically instead of dyanmically from github via AJAX on each page load.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/34268155-b2e1fb02-e64d-11e7-8c28-154516fa02d1.png" width="400">

I learned a bunch about Jeykll, github pages's static site generator, in order to build this. It was fun. Also hilarious how long it's taken me --  years! -- to get to know how Jeykll works given that I use it for all of my projects.

For example, in order to iterate on this without having to push to github each time, I needed to learn how to compile a jekyll site locally with `jeykll serve` but then also not include that in the project via `.gitignore`.

### Clearing up space on c9

Clearly the Cloud9 space detectors weren't working properly before because I didn't get any warnings about space on my 2GB machine, but I had 20GB of data on it! I first moved up to the 10GB machine but still needed to delete 10GB. I deleted a lot of projects I don't use anymore first. Then I figured out how to use `git sparse` to clean up this repo a bit. I tried using git large file system but 1) it solves a different problem and 2) it doesn't work with Github Pages. This was a bit annoying, and took an hour or two.

### Research recap episodes --> housekeeping

I recently [figured out that my "research recap" episodes are a waste of time](http://futureofcoding.org/log#cons-and-pros-of-my-current-schedule). I will move to a bi-weekly release schedule, and only do interview episodes. I explained this new structure [in the episode I released today, Dec 29, 2017, in the housekeeping section](/episodes/20).

### Less productive at home (since 01/15/17)

I've only gotten a dozen or so hours of work in since I've come home. It's partially a vacation so that's OK, but I would've prefered a bit more time to focus. I am making an effort to get ~4 hours of computer time in every weekday I'm here going forward, which is really only 4 days, including today.

## Next steps 01/01/18-01/19/18
