# Future of Coding Plan

- finish cleaning up the conversion of this doc from google docs to markdown
- Re read old version of the /plan, /about and recent /log
  - TODO
- /plan
  - Organize this outline
  - Write it!
- /goals
  - Like at TCS
- /about
  - Explain the community
  - And my part in it
- /community-guidelines
  - Collab on this via github issues, pull requests, etc

- The goal
  - Javascript / facebook
  - Better articulate this so I know when I&#39;m done
    - What is coding? What is art? What does the word language have to do with anything?
    - Future of &quot;communication&quot;? Augmenting humans? Augmenting thinking?
    - Genii be careful what you wish for. Get all you wish for (glench)
- My strategy
  - Framework: Intersection of things I am good at, enjoy, pays bills, impact
    - ![45c69235-ebfb-4c01-ab97-ce40195ab6df](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/32399269-0f892d24-c0cb-11e7-8414-fa02277eda1c.jpeg)
* Care less about money more about open source
* Medium is message
      - Git Linux Facebook
      - Elon / Jobs jerks. Zuck stole from early cofounders
      - I always wanted to be a model for others to follow and was sad when I realized that as a rich kid I was unrelatable
        - However now I wonder... we fight so our kids can become lawyers, philospohers, artists...
        - In a post scarcity world, can I be a model for people with UBI looking for meaning? What happens when all kids have trust funds? Burning man. Player piano.
        - When god, work ethic of burguisee disappear, what brings us meaning?
        - I was trying to be self made man of 20th century. I coulnd‘t be carnegie
        - More like spielfogel. Working hard even with a trust fund
        - Acknowledge all of the privilege
        - Separating the joy of creating from the necessary of creating
        - Getting over the shame, embracing the creative spirit, the artistic spirit to have fun to impact people, inspire them, entertain them
        - &quot;Not everyone can be an artist&quot; —&gt; yes they can! The world is a big place. Everyone has a website. That would‘ve been unheard of
        - Think about how we continue to get better
       * Lean
       * Decentralization with blockchain
       * Open source
       * Etc
       * Always at the beginning of infinity deutch
        - Mask and wig play / unibomber
  - Equal parts elon Musk (Hyperloop), Andre Staltz (CycleJS), Nicky Case (Explorable Explainations &amp; Patreon), Bret Victor (essays and talks), Justin Lafazan (NextGen Summit FB community), Sam Harris (thinking in public), &quot;and zero parts humble&quot; says my brother
  - Story of finding this strategy
 * Difficult to have a goal-oriented career like Elon as opposed to proccess oriented one like a doctor
 * Articulated my thinking around /about and /plan
      - Categorized dozens of ideas into 6 categories
      - Showed the table to Dan Shipper
      - #5 was clear to him (partially because it‘s most attractive to him as well)
      - Allows me to do 80% of my favorite parts and 20% of my least favorite parts
      - Works becuase I don‘t want control or lots of money
 * some processes to think about explicitly, some things in conversation, others subconsciously like in a math exam read problems first then go back
  - Main points of strategy
 * My activities will be research, writing, talks, interviews (customer and expert), podcasts, journaling, and prototyping
 * Goal is to be a thought leader &quot;thought leader&quot;
 * Not be a bottleneck. Come up with peer-to-peer ways of leveraging myself, community organizing
 * Publish problems
      - @r0ml: &quot;list of what things want to do would be valuable. Just their unfiltered asks.&quot;
        - What do kids want to do?
       *  Mischief, such as spamoji and Gmail phishing
2. Make money such as spamoji
3. Get acclaim and attention
4. Make something their friends use
5. Allow their friends to communicate, high score, chat room, make plans, share notes
6. Do something their friends think is hard.
7. Show their friends how to do something, teach friends
8. Earn money! Could getting kids bitcoin be a good idea? Get them a wallet where they couldn‘t have a bank account? Legality...?
 * business/product ideas
      - Musk hyperloop
      - Learnable programming -> TCS and WoofJS
        - Email to Bret TODO find this
        - Also emails to Granger and Alan with no response: make peer to peer like Justin Next Gen
        - Also always reply or have autoresponder about why not and send to right place
      - Tell the story of being at Looker and people saying that there were no tech companies doing interesting things. The problem is what problem to solve. Helping show people problems. Connecting people. Advising people. Empowering people.
      - Tell story of Lando and Heston saying too many dollars chasing too few companies
      - All about control. Employees or people I don‘t even talk to. Woofjs from LP. Or instruments of Elon.
      - Some ideas
        - Woof social network, teacher accounts
       * who‘s woof‘s customer? students? teachers? after school programs? how would they word their problem?
        - Woof/scratch resources site
        - Database for humans
        - Streamsheets / cyclejs devtools
        - Logichub
        - FoC community
        - Unbreakable links as a github pages competitor
        - ETL for humans
        - Embedable blocks
        - Embedable sprite editor
        - Embedable media selector
      - Prototypes
        - Release code
       * Not as much guilt or worry about premature adoption as Bret and Alan. More trust in this community. Not regret minimizing.
  - Targets
 * $2k per month from this project by July 1 2018
 * $4k per month by Jan 1 2019
 * 50k Twitter followers by Jan 1 2019
 * 50k people \* 1 hour over the year = 50k hours on my blogs / videos in 2018
 * Think about metric for projects created from my content
 * Think about metric for end user &quot;benefit&quot; from &quot;stuff&quot; FoC people create
 * Invited to keynote a conference like SPLASH by Jan 1 2019
  - Reactions from friends and family
 * Eli, &quot;yeah this is clearly what makes sense for you.&quot;
 * My mom says &quot;building your brand&quot;
 * Dad says &quot;you keep teaching me&quot;
 * Grandma says &quot;I better take care of myself. Gives me incentive to live long enough to see what you come up with.&quot;
 * Me &quot;I feel like this is the right path for me because I‘m terrified both of success and failure.&quot;
- Next steps
  - Putting a &quot;bow&quot; on my work at The Coding Space
 * Series of talks / essays
      - &quot;So you have an app idea&quot;
      - &quot;So you want to learn how to code&quot;
      - &quot;So you want someone else to learn to code&quot;
        - Include discussions of scalability and equity
        - Languages
       * Learnable programming
       * Scratch is amazing (finish this on medium or include here)
       * Not Ruby on Rails (Sam john post, monad tutorial fallacy). Meaningful to you and also intuitive.
       * Motivated by green checks, systematic
        - TODO listen to last few minutes of season 2 voice memo
        - Teaching method
       * Socratic
       * Emotional validation
       * Motivational interviewing
       * Top down with workflowy
       * Pimpelur vs school langauge vs duo lingo
       * School math vs IMACS
       * Peak
      - &quot;So you want to make tech more inclusive&quot;
        - Ask Nicole Kelner for help
        - Put keep notes for this in correct place
 * Figure out which conferences to give these talks
      - Key is great recording, right audience, close by, pay for travel
 * Transitioning WoofJS
      - Make post about who we‘re looking for.
      - Podcast episode about it
      - Open collective?
  - Organize my research list
 * think about organizing links, collecting notes on them,categorizing them, ranking them in terms of urgency, getting comments on each line
 * Douglas Englebart, augmenting humans at top
 * UI
      - Conal Elliot at top
 * Databases
      - Codd at top
 * Block chain
      - Guy who created ethereum at top
 * Check hckrnews once per week on calendar
 * Set times for reading / research every week on calendar
 * Think about platforms for decentralizing this research effort (stephan lesser convo)
      - maybe subreddit is the right platform...
  - Podcast structure
 * Season 2?
 * Stream of consciousness episodes?
 * Topical solo episodes?
  - Maintain a public list of blog topics
 * Migrate from trello
 * Also include &quot;overwhelming feeling while learning, crying with dancing and android phone, scheme vs rails&quot;
  - Community organizing
 * community guidelines like open source or sharing ndas secrets competitiveness
      - Figure out what license to give all my code and recommend to the community
        - Ask @r0ml. Also want open source if service as public performance
 * reach out to Justin at next gen summit ask Eli for because they run a killer fb group
 * Events in NYC
      - And other locations
 * Virtual events?
  - Sustainability
 * Look into Patreon and alternatives such as open collective
      - Interview Nicky Case
      - Interview Nadia engle
 * Explore &quot;give it back to community model with Zach Valenti&quot;
 * Look into Purpose Ventures
  - Twitter plan
 * Read advice on twitter
 * Find chats and hashtags that are relevant to me and join them
 * Make a list of my top influencers and engage with them
