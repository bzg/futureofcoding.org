# Future of Coding Plan

## Todos

* integrate this with /about and the older version of /plan
* create /goals
* update /about
* create /community-guidelines

## Why

Today and for the foreseeable future coding is the essence of empowerment: intellectual expression, economic freedom, and endless hours of serious fun.

TODO add emotions, human element into this. Maybe tell a story.

Coding is an extension of your imagionation. Dream it, code it.

ASPIRATIONAL. Your imagionation is the limit.

###  Mission 

Empower everyone to communicate and develop their ideas fully (and precisely?) (with computers?)

### Vision

Programming can be as easy to use as Facebook. (And more engaging?)

### Goals

[~90%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/12/evolution-of-technology/ft_17-01-10_internetfactsheets/) of Americans use the internet.
[~60%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183460/share-of-the-us-population-using-facebook/) of Americans use Facebook.
[~1%](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2483690/it-careers/india-to-overtake-u-s--on-number-of-developers-by-2017.html) of Americans know how to code.



## Strategy

This project is hard. Essentially hard. We can't do it alone. 

My strategy is to support the future of coding movement within the developer community.

What would the world look like if 10,000 developers were working full time on projects related to the future of coding?

### Priorities

#### Accomplish the goal

TODO

#### Medium is the message

- Git Linux Facebook
- Elon / Jobs jerks. Zuck stole from early cofounders
- I always wanted to be a model for others to follow and was sad when I realized that as a rich kid I was unrelatable
  - However now I wonder... we fight so our kids can become lawyers, philospohers, artists...
  - In a post scarcity world, can I be a model for people with UBI looking for meaning? What happens when all kids have trust funds? Burning man. Player piano.
  - When god, work ethic of burguisee disappear, what brings us meaning?
  - I was trying to be self made man of 20th century. I coulnd‘t be carnegie
  - More like spielfogel. Working hard even with a trust fund
  - Acknowledge all of the privilege
  - Separating the joy of creating from the necessary of creating
  - Getting over the shame, embracing the creative spirit, the artistic spirit to have fun to impact people, inspire them, entertain them
  - "Not everyone can be an artist" —> yes they can! The world is a big place. Everyone has a website. That would‘ve been unheard of
  - Think about how we continue to get better
       * Lean
       * Decentralization with blockchain
       * Open source
       * Etc
       * Always at the beginning of infinity deutch
        - Mask and wig play / unibomber
- Equal parts elon Musk (Hyperloop), Andre Staltz (CycleJS), Nicky Case (Explorable Explainations &amp; Patreon), Bret Victor (essays and talks), Justin Lafazan (NextGen Summit FB community), Sam Harris (thinking in public), "and zero parts humble" says my brother


## Anti-priorities

1. Control
2. Financial Success
3. Credit

### Sweetspot

- Framework: Intersection of things I am good at, enjoy, pays bills, impact
  - ![45c69235-ebfb-4c01-ab97-ce40195ab6df](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/32399269-0f892d24-c0cb-11e7-8414-fa02277eda1c.jpeg)

### Tactics

 * Invited to keynote a conference like SPLASH by Jan 1 2019
 * My activities will be research, writing, talks, interviews (customer and expert), podcasts, journaling, and prototyping
 * Goal is to be a thought leader "thought leader"
 * Not be a bottleneck. Come up with peer-to-peer ways of leveraging myself, community organizing

* Publish problems
  @r0ml: "list of what things want to do would be valuable. Just their unfiltered asks."
        - What do kids want to do?
       *  Mischief, such as spamoji and Gmail phishing
2. Make money such as spamoji
3. Get acclaim and attention
4. Make something their friends use
5. Allow their friends to communicate, high score, chat room, make plans, share notes
6. Do something their friends think is hard.
7. Show their friends how to do something, teach friends
8. Earn money! Could getting kids bitcoin be a good idea? Get them a wallet where they couldn‘t have a bank account? Legality...?
 * business/product ideas
      - Musk hyperloop
      - Learnable programming -> TCS and WoofJS
        - Email to Bret TODO find this
        - Also emails to Granger and Alan with no response: make peer to peer like Justin Next Gen
        - Also always reply or have autoresponder about why not and send to right place
      - Tell the story of being at Looker and people saying that there were no tech companies doing interesting things. The problem is what problem to solve. Helping show people problems. Connecting people. Advising people. Empowering people.
      - Tell story of Lando and Heston saying too many dollars chasing too few companies
      - All about control. Employees or people I don‘t even talk to. Woofjs from LP. Or instruments of Elon.
      - Some ideas
        - Woof social network, teacher accounts
       * who‘s woof‘s customer? students? teachers? after school programs? how would they word their problem?
        - Woof/scratch resources site
        - Database for humans
        - Streamsheets / cyclejs devtools
        - Logichub
        - FoC community
        - Unbreakable links as a github pages competitor
        - ETL for humans
        - Embedable blocks
        - Embedable sprite editor
        - Embedable media selector
      - Prototypes
        - Release code
       * Not as much guilt or worry about premature adoption as Bret and Alan. More trust in this community. Not regret minimizing.


### How I settled on this strategy

 * Difficult to have a goal-oriented career like Elon as opposed to proccess oriented one like a doctor
 * Articulated my thinking around /about and /plan
      - Categorized dozens of ideas into 6 categories
      - Showed the table to Dan Shipper
      - #5 was clear to him (partially because it‘s most attractive to him as well)
      - Allows me to do 80% of my favorite parts and 20% of my least favorite parts
      - Works becuase I don‘t want control or lots of money
 * some processes to think about explicitly, some things in conversation, others subconsciously like in a math exam read problems first then go back


### Feedback

 * Eli, "yeah this is clearly what makes sense for you."
 * My mom says "building your brand"
 * Dad says "you keep teaching me"
 * Grandma says "I better take care of myself. Gives me incentive to live long enough to see what you come up with."
 * Me "I feel like this is the right path for me because I‘m terrified both of success and failure."

### Sustainability

* $2k per month from this project by July 1 2018
* $4k per month by Jan 1 2019
* Foundations, think tanks, corporate sponsors, patreon, open collective
* Interview Nicky Case
* Interview nadia eghbal
* Explore "give it back to community model with Zach Valenti"

### Actionable metrics

* not vanity metrics
* ideas
  * time reading
  * github projects created
  * commits per day
  * number of hours end users spend in projects the community creates


## Next Steps

### Putting a "bow" on my work at The Coding Space

#### "So you think you have an app idea"

#### "So you want to learn to code"

* Pimpelur vs school langauge vs duo lingo
* Scratch is amazing (finish this on medium or include here)
* Learnable programming
* Not Ruby on Rails (Sam john post, monad tutorial fallacy). Meaningful to you and also intuitive.
* Motivated by green checks, systematic
* Top down with workflowy
* Peak

#### "So you want to someone else to learn to code"

* for the skill or for the transferable skills
* School math vs IMACS
* Socratic
* Emotional validation
* Motivational interviewing

#### "So you want to make tech more diverse and inclusive"

* with Nicole Kelner


### WoofJS

* Sustainability
* Looking for full time person (engineer or business?)
* Podcast


### Future of Coding

#### State of Future of Coding

* yearly post about progress in various sections
* Maintain a list of product ideas
 * Similar to PG‘s list - look at that for context
 * But others can add their thoughts so maybe github issues

##### Databases

##### Collaboration

##### Version control

##### Deployment

##### Authentication

##### Analytics

##### Libraries / dependencies / importing & exporting

##### TODO: something about blocks, sytnax errors

##### Computational Metaphors

##### Foundational Architecture

#### Community

* slack group
* meetups online
* community guidelines like open source or sharing ndas secrets competitiveness
  * Figure out what license to give all my code and recommend to the community
    * Ask @r0ml. Also want open source if service as public performance
* reach out to Justin at next gen summit ask Eli for because they run a killer fb group


#### Research

* Think about platforms for decentralizing this research effort (stephan lesser convo)
  * maybe subreddit is the right platform...
  * wiki?
* Organize my research list
* think about organizing links, collecting notes on them,categorizing them, ranking them in terms of urgency, getting comments on each line
* Douglas Englebart, augmenting humans at top
* Conal Elliot at top for computational metaphors
* Codd at top for databases
* guy who created etherium on top for foundational archatechure
* continue working on twitter list (and newsletters) of people to follow here
* Check hckrnews once per week on calendar
* Set times for reading / research every week on calendar


#### Writing

* Migrate from trello public to github issues probably
  * Also include "overwhelming feeling while learning, crying with dancing and android phone, scheme vs rails"
  

#### Podcast

* Season 2?
* Stream of consciousness episodes?
* Topical solo episodes?
 

#### Twitter

* Make a list of my top influencers and engage with them
* Create twitter chat?
* Create hashtag?
