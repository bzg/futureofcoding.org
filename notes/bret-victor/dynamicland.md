## Day 1

_Jan 15, 2018_

Wow, I'm not even sure where to start. I guess I can summarize the day.

I arrived at 1pm. Luke gave me a tour of the space, then I got lunch with Toby, Bret, Josh, and Luke. Back at the space, I walked around, reading the posters on the wall. That was fun and overwhelming -- there's so much content that I didn't know about. 

I was finally saved by Virgina who was working on projecting an image of survey results onto a table. We first had to figure out how to project an image onto a table, which is called a "supporter" and scale its size. Then we decided we wanted it to mirror itself across the table so that people on either side could see the table. In order to do that, we needed to change the way we were displaying the image to use the Illuminator library directly, instead of using an image helper function (which didn't have rotation). It was a little fustrating to have to use the standard canvas that draws things from the top-left corner, with a context, etc.

I have a few project ideas:

* Scratch/WoofJS sprite abstraction library
* functional programming composable widgets
* how many things can we build without typing?

I also want to see what ways I could help with fundraising. Here are some ideas:

* connections to federal government
* asking Linda Kronfield, Brett Berson, Phin for fundraising advice
* organizing Sand Hill Road Trip (bring projector? slide deck?)

Also, Luke said that it could be possible for me to host an event in the space on Sunday, my birthday. I want to double check with them tomorrow and will then see if there are people around. That could be a blast hackathon birthday!!
