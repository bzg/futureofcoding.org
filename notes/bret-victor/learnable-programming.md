I love the way he starts this article:

> Here's a trick question: How do we get people to understand programming?

I wholeheartedly agree with "Programming is a way of thinking, not a rote skill." I'm not sure "People understand what they can see." is as immediately obvious to me. I would prefer to simply use visuals "support and encourage powerful ways of thinking." No need to having "seeing" as an axiom.

## Contents 

> A programming system has two parts. The programming "environment" is the part that's installed on the computer. The programming "language" is the part that's installed in the programmer's head.

### Will Wright on games

Given that this article inspired one of the main framings (environment vs language) of this essay, I figured I might as well read it... Some great quotes:

> The types of games we do are simulation based... As a player, a lot of what you’re trying to do is reverse engineer the simulation. You’re trying to solve problems within the system, you’re trying to solve traffic in SimCity, or get somebody in The Sims to get married or whatever. The more accurately you can model that simulation in your head, the better your strategies are going to be going forward. So what we’re trying to as designers is build up these mental models in the player. The computer is just an incremental step, an intermediate model to the model in the player’s head. The player has to be able to bootstrap themselves into understanding that model. You’ve got this elaborate system with thousands of variables, and you can’t just dump it on the user or else they’re totally lost. So we usually try to think in terms of, what’s a simpler metaphor that somebody can approach this with? What’s the simplest mental model that you can walk up to one of these games and start playing it, and at least understand the basics? Now it might be the wrong model, but it still has to bootstrap into your learning process. So for most of our games, there’s some overt metaphor that allows you approach the simulation.

> Like for SimCity, most people see it as kind of a train set. You look at the box and you say "Oh, yeah, it’s like a train set come to life." Or The Sims, "it’s like a doll house come to life." But at the same, when you start playing the game, and the dynamics become more apparent to you, a lot of time there’s an underlying metaphor that’s not so apparent. Like in SimCity, if you really think about playing the game, it’s more like gardening. So you’re kind of tilling the soil, and fertilizing it, and then things pop up and they surprise you, and occasionally you have to go in and weed the garden, and then you maybe think about expanding it, and so on. So the actual process of playing SimCity is really closer to gardening. In either case, your mental model of the simulation is constantly evolving.

> One thing that we found in playing with The Sims is that it’s pretty important that you have a consistent level of abstraction. It doesn’t make sense to have everything highly detailed except one aspect and then have it abstracted. So in fact you want the entire world and the entire representation to be abstracted at almost the same level. At which point it holds together very nicely. It’s kind of hard for you to go into a system and then be filling in the blanks of this one component, while everything else is highly detailed. So in The Sims, even the building is fairly abstracted. You can only put a wall within about a meter. The objects are somewhat abstracted in terms of selection: you don’t have the full selection that you would really have in a furniture store. The granules of interaction in the game are kind of abstracted. So having that consistency, in your head, you fill in the blanks really well. And this is something that kids do quite well of course. You watch kids playing with toys. They’re doing it all the time, very naturally. And even adults are doing that much of the time, with reading books, for example, where there are a lot of blanks to be filled in.

This is a great summary of the goal behind LogicHub:

> So you’ve got these people out there with all these different models.. A lot of people have talked to me over the years about community modeling. But not so much as a modeling tool, but more as a communication tool, using something like SimCity where people get involved in a planning process and get a sense of their community or the environment or whatever. Where the purpose of the model in those cases would be to come to a shared agreement about what the model is.
> 
> We did a project actually several years ago called Sim Health for the Markle Foundation in New York. It was a simulation of the national healthcare system, but underneath the whole thing, the assumptions of the model were exposed. And you could change your assumptions, for example, as to how many nurses it takes to staff a hospital, or how many emergency room visits you would have given certain parameters, etc., etc. The idea was that people could kind of argue over policy but eventually that argument would come down to the assumptions of the model. And this was a tool for them to actually get into the assumptions of the model. When people disagree over what policy we should be following, the disagreement flows out of a disagreement about their model of the world. The idea was that if people could come to a shared understanding or at least agree toward the model of the world, then they would be much more in agreement about the policy we should take.
> 
> CP: So in a way, a system like that could be used to externalize mental models and create a collective model.. it’s not so much like you all have the same mental model, but that you have an externalized model that everyone agrees to abide by.

Wow, video games could be a more effective vector for Seymour Papert powerful ideas than coding:

> At some level I want people to have a deep appreciation for how connected things are at all these different scales, not just through space, but through time. And in doing so I had to build kind of a simple little toy universe and say, here, play with this toy for a while. My expectations when I hand somebody that toy are that they are going to make their own mental model, which isn’t exactly what I’m presenting them with. But whatever it is, their mental model of the world around them, and above them and below them, will expand. Hopefully, probably in some unpredictable way, and for me that’s fine. And I don’t want to stamp the same mental model on every player. I’d rather think of this as a catalyst. You know, it’s a catalytic tool for growing your mental model, and I have no idea which direction it’s going to grow it, but I think just kind of sparking that change is worthwhile unto itself.

Makes me want to do research on Minecraft x Papert. Here are some links TODO:

I'm really getting revved up with the idea of video games, because they align things reasonably well: kids LOVE video games AND convince their parents to pay for them. Minecraft sold to Microsoft for $2.5B.

### Environment / langauge goals

While he starts with the environment, I'd rather start from *the user* who doesn't know how to code.

I believe the core challenge of learning to program is: **the assimilation of models.**

Bret calls this: "identity and metaphor -- _how can I relate the computer's world to my own?_")

In order to be able to make anything, the user needs to have a ever-improving model of how their tools behave. For example, think about about a child assimilates the model of a hammer. It's clear from the way it's shaped from which end to pick it up. Then when you pick it up, you immediatley notice that it's much heavier on one side. And of course you've seen others people use hammers, so the model snaps right into place: swing this near where I want it to make a BAM.

#### Powerful mental models / ideas

Now taking this a step further, we as programming language designers want to embed a model inside a child's head that will enable them to be powerful. We know that different mental models are more powerful than others. For example roman numerals are much less powerful than arabic numerals. We know that [systems thinking is more powerful than linear thinking](http://ncase.me/OVC2016/#uninformed).

Thus we want to help students assimilate *powerful* mental models, what Seymour Papert called "powerful ideas." Bret lists some of these:

> decomposition -- how do I break down my thoughts into mind-sized pieces?
> recomposition -- how do I glue pieces together?

These are the two-sides of the *composability* coin. As we've learned from functional programming, composibility is a very powerful idea. It allows us to do *top-down design*, where one decomposes a problem into its subproblems in such a way that solving the sub-problems automatically solves the solution -- because you've pre-composed the sub-problems properly before solving them.

So now that we know composability is a powerful idea, the question to ask is how do we help a new user assimilate it? In his article, Bret compares LOGO and Hypercard to ProcessingJS to show how limited it is on both of these fronts. However, I would be excited by a more thorough discussion on how to build intuitively for decomposition and recomposition.

Other powerful mental models/ideas include:

* referential transparency (partitioning side-effects) 
* type system

#### Powerful ways of working

Additionally, we know about some powerful ways of working:

* creating by reacting to what's on the screen
* abstracting similar code via variables/functions
* working in small steps
* refactoring code to be more readable, faster, etc
* version control workflow branching
* planning a project, estimating time, github issues, prioritizing

## The features are not the point

> We often think of a programming environment or language in terms of its features -- this one "has code folding", that one "has type inference". This is like thinking about a book in terms of its words -- this book has a "fortuitous", that one has a "munificent". What matters is not individual words, but how the words together convey a message.

Love it!

## Read the vocabulary

> Thought experiment. Imagine if you bought a new microwave, took it out of the box, and found a panel of unlabeled buttons. Imagine if the microwave encouraged you to randomly hit buttons until you figured out what they did.

Great metaphor!

The demo of hover over for documentation inline is so beautiful. Makes me wonder if we could add that to WoofJS... In Woof, the sprites are given named parameters, so that's ok. However, we could probably improve the understanding of control structures if we added side-notes about them. Currently we add those notes inline in comments which is just awkward. It would also be nice if WoofJS had live update so users could see in real time the effect of their changes - it's a bummer we reload the entire page on any change.

## Follow the flow

Ah, this section is criticizing what I just mentioned, the immediate update, in addition to not showing incremental steps.

> People understand things that they can see and touch.

For-loops are the worst. I'd definitely vote to replace them with iterating over an array. Or even a while-loop if neccesary.

Allowing the programmer to scrub through the steps is great. In particular it allows them to see how/why things loop around. This would probably entirely eliminate one of the first questions that almost every Scratch student has of how forever-loops work. This is a big deal. The more of those questions we eliminate, the less need there is of trained teachers, the more the environment can scale.

Of course, I am excited with functional programming ideas, which have a less-intuitive model of flow. Yet it enables higher comprehension and more powerful thinking once you do understand it. I think the Elm time travel debuggers and the CycleJS devtools diagrams point in interesting directions.

### Make flow visible

Really cool section! Love the metaphor to driving directions. Also love the way he abstracts over iterations of a loop. He's totally on point that this could be super helpful when you're curious when the loop goes into an inner-if statement.

### Make time tangible

This is cool too! Giving users another way to slice a program. See it from another angle. 

However, there feels like a slight arbitrary-ness to some of these examples. That is, I wonder if there's a way to build a langauge in which it's easy to build this visualization tools on top of so that people could build and publish these just like they build and publish libraries and frameworks.

### Make time visible

Beautiful! This is allowing us to see the path of an object all at once on the screen. Very reminiscent of the Ladder of Abstraction and also the Elm mario time travel debugger (which was probably inspired by this essay).

### Summary — Follow the flow

> The environment can make flow tangible, by enabling the programmer to explore forward and backward at her own pace.

This is key. Time travel debugger.

> The environment can make flow visible, by visualizing the pattern of execution.

This is also key. CycleJS devtools diagram.

> The environment can represent time at multiple granularities, such as frames or event responses, to enable exploration across these meaningful chunks of execution.

Again, this sounds to me like add-ons that the community could build given a really solid underlying structure. A structure that Conal Elliot would build. Perfect abstractions.

### FRP Scratch

I'm reading this essay in part in terms of a new programming environment for children that I've been thinking about recently. Sometimes I call it an FRP Scratch. It's like Scratch but with a more functional reactive runtime, so as to enable time travel debugging and also a CycleJS-like diagram of the code.

Yet my conversation with Jason Brennan is making me rethinking directly copying Scratch as much as I was planning to. That is, there's a lot of really interesting metaphors and abstractions outside of Scratch that haven't been explored. For example: direct manipulation. But of course direct manipulation, while intuative, does seem to limit the power of the comptutational abstractions. Things to think about!

## See the state

> The computer somehow drew that picture, so the computer must have calculated all those scaleFactors itself. Are you seriously recalculating them in your head?
>
> ... setting a "breakpoint" ... is like monitoring traffic on the freeway by setting up a barricade ... writing to a "console" ... is like figuring out where your dog goes during the day by following the trail of droppings.
>
>
> The entire purpose of code is to manipulate data, and we never see the data. We write with blindfolds... 
> ... Spreadsheets rule because they show the data.
> ... Edward Tufte has one primary rule... Show the data.
> ... the number one thing you can do is to show the data.

Beautiful. I'm sold. Let's show the data!

### Show the data

This becomes easier when you can step through time easily.

### Show comparisons

![screenshot 2018-01-06 at 10 49 33 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/34641266-5f0962fc-f2cf-11e7-91e6-231235e00144.png)

Woah. I forgot about this. Beautiful...

And then when I was mesmerized by that plot, he hit me with the knockout punch: 

> Is it possible to understand a loop with, say, thousands of iterations, without drowning in thousands of numbers?
>
> Yes -- there is an entire field of study devoted to depicting large amounts of numbers. To visualize this data, we can use all of the standard techniques of data visualization.

And then he turns the table plot to a graph. And I died. Holy crap I really need to read this Tufte guy. Looks liek Amazon lost the package of his book in transit... Let me call them now.

### Eliminate hidden state

I love how he explains the two ways to eliminate hiddden state:

1. Make it non-hidden
2. Show it

WoofJS improves on the way ProcssingJS (or the normal canvas API) exposes color changes by making them explicit extra local parameters to sprites, as opposed to implicit global state. However, WoofJS still has hidden global data in the form of variables as well as the attributes of sprites, which can be changed from anywhere in the code.

Scratch (and Bret's demo) show global variables by simply putting them on the screen (unless you choose to hide them.) Very straightforward.

Woah, the way he makes transformation matrixes understandable by visualizing them is beautiful! Why hadn't I thought of that?!

This is a great rule: "All state must be eliminated or shown."

## Create by reacting

### Get something on the screen as soon as possible

This is pretty straightforward. WoofJS does this well with autocomplete. 

> Strangely, I don't actually know of any APIs that are intentionally designed with autocomplete in mind. I do know many APIs, such as Processing, that are designed for brevity, which is irrelevant in an environment with good autocomplete.

Well WoofJS was designed with autocomplete in mind. Typing out all the parameter names was never part of the deal. I knew those would be written for you.

### Dump the parts bucket onto the floor

Scratch does a pretty good job of this. WoofJS does a slightly worse job but still pretty good - and we're going to make it more like Scratch soon. Dynamicland makes this really interesting because you can literally dump the programming constructs on the literal floor (or put them on a bookshelf).

#### Direct manipulation

The direct manipulation stuff he shows here is also very cool.

Direct manipulation is clearly the best interface we can imagine for those sorts of concrete things that can be directly manipulated. Yet when one is trying to abstract, direct manipulation because less clear, because, of course, there is not something concrete to manipulate.

I think I have happened upon an interesting semantic twist of phrase. Direct manipulation of concrete visual objects is simply dragging them around with your mouse in the appropriate way. This is clearly directly manipulating the object, as opposed to indirectly manipulating another object somewhere else and then seeing the change on the target object. Yet, what about an abstraction? What would it mean to directly manipulate an abstraction? Well that would merely mean to manipulate it directly, not indirectly, which I'm taking to mean, manipulate it in itself, not by manipulating something else. 

All this talk of manipulating something, itself, and not somewhere else is making me think of [Andre Staltz's writings on consolidating all ways an object can change within the object itself](https://futurice.com/blog/reactive-mvc-and-the-virtual-dom), which of course form the basis of FRP systems like CycleJS.

## Create by abstracting

> Learning programming is learning abstraction... [Without abstraction it'd] makes no sense at all... What is the point of learning to "code", if it's just a way of getting the computer to do things that are easier to do directly?

### Start constant, then vary

I'm glad Bret and [Brent](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/) agree.

On the surface level, I really love the demo of creating variables from concrete numbers, and then extending those variables throughout the code by connecting them to other concrete numbers. You've gotta admit, you'd never think of that! It concieves of variables in a really neat way. 

Yet, I imagine that many professional programmers see it as a unneccsary visual gimmick. But then, those programmers would be far from their experience of learning variables, and thus would not see how confusing learning abstraction is.

In my experience teaching computer science, I saw this all the time. For example, one of our more advanced students created a choose your own adventure game where you'd first pick a character, then a location, then a pet, etc. And he accomplished this logic by first creating one branch of the code, and then copying and pasting it lower down and changing relevant variables. He had built up this rickety structure to thousands of lines of code, which, if he had used abstraction, could've been 10x shorter. 

There were three problems apparent:

1. The fact that the interface, which in this case was my interface WoofJS, didn't automatically lend itself well to abstraction. The fact that copy-and-paste was the easiest way to acommplish this is a bummer. (A similar thing is true of Scratch programs, which are known to turn into spagetti code.)

2. When I went to help this student with a particular bug, I personally found the code so large and incomprehensible that I was unable to help him with the code in its current state. Yet I was *unable to communicate the benefits of abstraction sufficiently to convince* this child to learn them and refactor his code. I was saved only by my co-founder and co-teacher in this class who proposed it this way: "Steve wants to teach you a really advanced thing called a variable. It's like a magic hack."

3. Once the child was explained (and the fact that they had to be explained, not intuited from the interface is the 1st listed here) the basic concepts behind variables and functions, they were still unable to apply them to accomplish their aims. In other words, they still prefered copy-and-paste, which if you think about it, is really the obvious approach to *start constant, and then vary*.

Given all of these observations of problems, I would propose I method of building abstraction that builds ontop of a child's natural inclination to copy and paste. This would be messy, but possible, in a texual interface. You could do what I was helping this student do manually: search through the text for similar chunks that only differ in a few key places, and if found, ask the user if they would like you to replace those chuncks with call to functions with the appropriate parameters.

In a non-textual interface, this could be even cleaner because the very interface they use to "duplicate" a chunk of code in the UI could lead them to an interface for abstraction.

Given the beauty and power of functional programming and functional abstraction, I believe that there are likely beautiful visual metaphors to be found that could make proccess seamlessly intuative for students.

### Start with one, then make many

Again, this is beautiful. Yet I fear I would have to agree with the vetran programmer who looks at this like it's a visual gimmick. I can't imagine any beginner programmer actually being able to climb up the ladder of abstraction in this way. How does a student go from: I want these houses to have different heights to I can describe my house as a function of a height parameter/variable, and then call it with different values? 

But of course, I'm attacking a strawman here because even Bret wouldn't defend these demos as usable. He's merely trying to articulate what usable would look like. As Bret would doubtless agree, the words "function" and "var" are far too arcane for students to intuit.

I could see the "layer" metaphor from Photoshop being an interesting place to start. It seems like [Figma's components feature](https://blog.figma.com/components-in-figma-e7e80fcf6fd2) is pretty intuative, yet I'd prefer more explicitness around what's overriding what and when -- and in general more abstractness. (Looks like [someone at Figma is a fan of Xerox PARC...](https://rsms.me/1950s-called-wanted-toolbox-back))

## Langauge

### Great works

Ah, such nostalgia for this section of this essay. If Bret didn't curse at me to read Mindstorms, who knows where I'd be today?

### Identity and metaphor

From my personal experience I can vouch for the power of identifying with the LOGO turtle. In the medium-is-the-message sense, even more powerful is the felt sense of what it feels to intuit in one's own body how to figure things out, understand things. I truly feel like my self confidence in problem solving was built *in my body* with LOGO experiences.

> Smalltalk, like Logo, also has a strong resonant metaphor, which is the message... "Assignment statements -- even abstract ones -- express very low-level goals... Human programmers aren't Turing machines -- and the less their programming systems require Turing machine techniques, the better."

This is a good point. Sequential programming and variables must die. I'm not saying that Haskell or Elm are the pinacle of intuative, but they are closer to the right level of abstraction than the thin layers of abstraction we have over computer hardware architecture.

### Decomposition

> Modularity is the human mind's lever against complexity. Breaking down a complex thing into understandable chunks is essential for understanding, perhaps the essence of understanding.

Yes, modularity, compression, and analogy. These make sense to me as the basis for understanding.

#### LOGO

> Logo uses the metaphor of "teaching the turtle a new word". 

This doesn't seem that clever. It's merely another name for a subroutine. And, of course, all sequential code is difficult to decompose so that's not great.

> ... Long and careful thought was given to the process by which a learner discovers the need for subprocedures, and then factors a large procedure into subprocedures.

I'd be really curious to [know more about this long and careful thoughts...](./questions)


#### Forth

Side note: the way this langauge explicitly deals with pushing and popping this to the stack makes me wonder about how we call functions: the name of the function, followed by its parameters. It's just adding stuff to the stack. So crazy. Even haskell, `reduce (+) 0 [1,2 3]` is so simplistic. Well, I guess that's simplisitic for lambda calculus reasons, and less stack-reasons. Ugh, just get me to a better place then text.

Direct note: the most interesting thing is how little Forth does, and yet how powerful it is. I love the escape hatches to assembly. Such a great langauge for assemly nerds.

#### [Why Functional Programming Matters](http://worrydream.com/refs/Hughes-WhyFunctionalProgrammingMatters.pdf)

Really a brilliant article. And now I have a better sense of what Bret means below in the recomposition section. The key insight of this essay is that functional programming langauges, like Haskell, aren't great only because of what they eliminiate, such as mutable variables, but what they add, such as HOF and lazy evaluation, both of which I really didn't appreciate enough until this essay. 

The fun analogy he uses is that it's not the elimination of GOTO that's important but the addition of named subroutines. In a similar vein, it's less important that we rid ourselves of side-effects, than that we add support for HOF and lazy evaluation which allow for modularity, which is the most important thing.

Yet! I foud myself falling asleep at the wheel while reading some of the more mathmatical sections of this essay, which some FP essays tend towards. It makes me wonder: it seems like the reason FP is so great is modularity through mathmatical abstraction, yet that's also what makes it so difficult to parse. And thus why I'm so excited about where the CycleJS FRP diagram points. Taking functional programming and visualizing it in such a beautiful, non-textual way. 

Basically, I am trying to reconcile my and Bret's love of functional programming and our mutual desire to "kill math," when the FP that we both love is based upon and looks quite similar to the mathmatics that we both want to kill. It's almost nonesensical when you put it that way, huh? This Bret guy wants to make programming more like math, but then kill math? This is another good [question](./questions)...


### Recomposition

> Creating is remixing. To a large extent, new ideas are old ideas in new combinations.

Well, there it is: analogy as the core of creation.

Hypercard is the bomb.com - maybe Joe Cohen will figure out how to bring it to the Web.

#### No global state

Proccessing's recomposition is the worst because of poor encapulation / global state. Just another argument for no global state.

But you must have some, right? What is global state? It's merely an object/dictionary at the top level, often implicitly referenced. You can make it less implicit by referecing it directly, which in javascript would be the `window` object, which all variables are defined upon, more or less, I'm not certain of the details, and the subtleties of const, var, let, or using none of these.

Alan Kay's World's paper got me thinking about the advantages of making global state less explicit. But even Haskell has a notion of global state. It's just not mutable. And then it can be imported into other global states as a module. I don't really like this.

When you want to reference something, there are a few ways: it's name, it's location, it's contents, or it's unique ID. Under the hood, Paul's Unison langauge refers to all definitions by a hash of its contents. In this way, symbolic name really is just a pointer to stuff underneath. IPFS works in a similar way. This also reminds me of Rich Hickey's view of the world: a named entity is simply the stream of a series of values over time that represent that name.

Anyways, back to global state: it can be entirely eliminated with content-hashed-references, because it's in effect copying-and-pasting all over the place. In this world, names are just labels for actual stuff. 

I can't put a finger on why, but this feels like a powerful insight. But then again, it might just be a feeling.

#### Sequencing and monads

Despite all my FP and Haskell experience, I never felt very comforatable with monads. This is probably related to the fact that I only used Haskell in the university setting. However, potentially monads aren't needed for sequencing side-effect-y code. That's what FRP is supposed to be for, right? This section of the essay, unsurprisingly, is making me want to do my Conal Elliot FRP deep dive sooner rather than later.

### Readability

[The apple naming methods guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/Articles/NamingMethods.html) is amazing! My first thought is that this could be a great starting place for building a graphical library that makes some of these ideas intuitively embeded in the landscape. Yet of course words do a good job of this as well. 

In a proper interface we wouldn't have to worry as much about camel case since Alcuin of York did indeed invent the concept of spaces between words hundred of years ago. 

This reminds me of my idea to build a more human-readable regex. I continue reflecting on this idea [here](/essays/regex-for-humans).

## Okay then

> The design principles presented in this essay can be used as a checklist to evaluate a programming system for learning.

I am the only person I am aware of to [take this seriously](https://medium.com/@stevekrouse/woof-d9adf2110fc6).

To evaluate this checklist, as a checklist, I'd have to say that it's more provacative than it is helpful.

### These are not training wheels

> A frequent question about the sort of techniques presented here is, "How does this scale to real-world programming?" 

Yep, I get this question a lot.

> This is a reasonable question, but it's somewhat like asking how the internal combustion engine will benefit horses. The question assumes the wrong kind of change.

I'm not sure I buy this argument anymore. It's like asking, how the ICE will *interact* with horses, not benefit them. That would be akin to asking, how do these changes benefit programmers, which is not what these people are asking.

> Here is a more useful attitude: Programming has to work like this... Given these requirements, how do we redesign programming?

This is an emperical claim about the usefulness of a given attitude towards solving a problem. I am doubtful that it this is true.

#### No Silver Bullet

Hard to believe I've never read this before! Notes continued [here](/notes/no-silver-bullet).

## Footnotes

My acquaintance Christina Cacioppo (which makes sense) and Stripe's Patrick Collison (which is more confusing) gave feedback on this essay.

And *another* imporing to read Mindstorms! I didn't realize he says it *4* times!

## Reflections...

Well it'd take so much time to reflect on my reflections on this essay that I don't even want to go there.

But I will say that I got a lot out of this. It's difficult to imagine a world where I haven't read Will Wright, Fred Brooks, and the other tangents I went down here. I have a much deeper sense of Bret's world now that I've gotten a sense of his influences. I am excited to dig into Tufte, possibly tomorrow morning!

This is less related to this particular essay, but... I'm also beginning to detect a communication style that Bret (and others in social activism) use that is compelling (because it plays off of our favorite emotion: outrage), but not helpful for solving problems. It makes me wonder where the "get up and go" to persue a social cause comes from, if not from outrage (or the desire to be right, or to achieve high status). That is, I am theorizing that people with social causes are *less*, not more, concerned with the happiness of other people, despite them purporting to work on their behalf. If they were truly interested in the needs of other people, why not help people in the terms which they want to be helped?
