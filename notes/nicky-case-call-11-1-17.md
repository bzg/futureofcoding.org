    * a game theory where people can upload AIs and battle each other out to figure out research questions
* storytelling steps
  1. All about connections
  2. Know who your audience is (so you know their connections)
    a. Bret Victor is not into programming. He's just talking to programmers so he's talking in terms they'd understand.
  3. Start with graph of knowledge / endpoint
  4. Start point: start with why. 
    a. Connect to something they already care about. 
    b. Make them love the question.
    c. Give them an interesting problem to solve. 
    d. Story
    e. Big question (how do people learn?)
  5. Figure out best traversal of graph
    a. Draw 3 outlines first to think about different structures 
    b. Outline look like boxes with words connected by arrows of "therefore" or "but" (South Park guys)
    c. Can do "meanwhile back at the ranch"
  6. For each node in graph, connect to things people already know
    a. Metaphors to things people already know about
    b. Examples
    c. Show
    d. Allow audience to "do"
