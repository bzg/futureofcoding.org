# Aaron Kent Call 9/15/17

* Scala people

* really inspired by Paul's book

* he and his brother were inspired by gang of four, out of tarpit, functional programming, accidental complexity, etc

* they hadn't seen Prune but I told them about it (very similar, such as ? node)

* quit their jobs three years ago to work on this full time 

* told about https://www.webscript.io/

* he's referencing paul quotes from our most recent podcast! spotify for coding, hashing functions

* spent a year to get a first prototype, then spent another year iterating with people on design

* what are you optimizing for right now?
  * assuming that there's a time where it's free
  * raise funds now, and then have a year of runway to get to revenue
 
* not open source now, but want to be as much as possible
  * open to what makes sense here
  

* graph.cool
